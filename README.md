# xtract.chat


## General Information
A pubsub built with scaling in mind. Simply: Node.js tcp server with a redis caching backend.

Started with Noobhub, but with lots of research, decided to build something a more robust.
This is the open source variation that is used on xtractstudios/codes games.

**WARNING:** this is very 'alpha' and probably will not work locally until a release is finished.
